Scrabble!
========

This is a Swing-based implementation of the Scrabble board game in Java. It was
written over the course of half a school year (1 and a half trimesters) as part
of AP Computer Science II and Advanced Programming. It utilizes many of
the core concepts learned in the classes and more. 

I wrote this during the infancy of my computer science career, so the code is not
particularly pretty or well-designed. I'd redo the whole thing, but I'd rather
move on to learn new things instead of stagnating with this for too long.


## How to Use
Download this repository, and navigate to the root directory of the project.
Then use `java -jar dist/scrabble.jar` to run the project.

*Note:* If you aren't in the root projects folder, Java won't be able to find
the files in the resources folder (pictures, dictionary, etc.) so make sure
to run it in the correct location.
